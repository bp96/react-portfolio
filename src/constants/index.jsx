      <p>
        This was my Master's project conducted at the University of Manchester
        with collaboration with The Christie NHS Foundation Trust. The first
        part involved setting up a project pipeline to read in MRI image files
        (in NIfTI file format), pre-process them and storing these images. These
        were then used for large feature extraction using a package called
        radiomics.
        <br />
        <br />
        The second part involved using the above pipeline, and a U-Net style
        convolutional neural network (CNN) to employ deep learning; this was
        used to segment two main defined cancerous regions - the gross tumour
        volume (GTV) which indicates the visible, macroscopic spread, and
        clinical tumour volume (CTV), which includes the GTV plus some of the
        surrounding area (containing possible microscopic spread).
        <br />
        <br />
        GTV segmentation had also never done before using deep learning for
        cervical cancer at the time. The technique employed transfer learning
        using the ImageNet database (due to the limited size of the dataset of
        cervical cancer images) and in the end, accuracies of 55-80% were
        obtained in identifying the correct GTV/CTV regions. This project was
        predominantly Python-based though some MATLAB and Lua code had to be
        written as well. For future work, it would also be possible to repeat
        this technique on other sets of clinical images.

      <p>
        This project involved reviewing techniques in generating synthetic data,
        driven by the need of sharing sensitive data for R&D purposes. The
        synthetic data generation tools aimed to mimic characteristics of the
        real dataset whilst removing or obscuring the sensitive information
        present within the real data. The final report was made public here on{" "}

          href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/synthetic-data"

        .
        <br />
        <br />
        For example, we might want the synthetic data to retain the range of
        values of the original data with similar (but not the same) outliers. Or
        we might want to retain a similar frequency distribution in the
        synthetic and original datasets. However, this becomes more complex when
        we start to consider interactions between fields, or different types of
        data such as free text and GPS locations.
        <br />
        <br />
        Working in a team, I helped explore public datasets which were similar
        to those used by the customer and identified tools which could be used
        to produce synthetic data. For example, the Czech financial database
        comprised of numerical/categorical data was used with the Synthetic Data
        Vault (sdv) Python package whilst the text-based resumes/CSVs were used
        with Microsoft's open-source tool called "Presidio" (which was also
        powered by AI algorithms).
        <br />
        <br />
        SDV worked with relational tables and from the testing and analysi using
        cross-correlation heat maps and histograms, the tool produced mixed
        results since it only seemed to work with Gaussian-distirbuted data.
        This often led to odd results such as negative bank ID values - however,
        since the tool is open-source, it's still currently in development and
        the ability to specify other distributions may be added in at a later
        date.
